# NYT Web Scraper

This scraper program is designed to retrieve articles from the New York Times website using two methods: the NY Times API and general web scraping techniques.

## NY Times API
We use the NY Times API to retrieve articles metadata that the NY Times makes publicly available. This includes headline, lead_paragraph, author, publication date, etc. 

## Web Scraping
After that, we use web scraping to retrieve the article text. We use the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries for this purpose.

**Please note**: We are only able to use web scraping to retrieve articles in the second phase because we have a digital subscription to the NY Times. Without a subscription, web scraping may be in violation of the NY Times' terms of service. Please use this program responsibly and ensure that you have the appropriate permissions before using it.
